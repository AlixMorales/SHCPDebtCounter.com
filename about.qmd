## About SHCP Debt Counter

This website came to me in the middle of sitting through a CNN lecture where I happened to remember about the utter importance of SHCP Debt. I then had an epiphany and realized that I could turn my dream (shcpdebttracker.com) into a reality! With this vibe coded quarto app I can track the shcp debts!

### Features
Pretty Damn self explanatory but if someone messes with this site (plz dont) this is how you can fuck up my tracker:

- **Add Debts**: Input services, rents, or charges with their monetary values
- **Record Payments**: Enter payments made and automatically deduct them from the total debt
- **Visualize Debts**: See all debts and payments in an organized table
- **Total Debt Sum**: Automatically calculates the net debt (total debts minus total payments)
- **Persistent Storage**: Your data is stored locally in your browser

### How to Use
Read Above

1. **Add a Debt**: Enter a description and amount, then click "Add Debt"
2. **Record Payment**: Enter the payment amount and click "Record Payment"
3. **View History**: See all your debts and payments in the history sections
4. **Delete Items**: Remove any debt or payment by clicking the "Delete" button

### Data Storage

All data is stored locally in your browser using localStorage. This means... you can't fuck with my actual counter 🤪🤪

- Your data persists between sessions
- Your data is private and never sent to any server
- Clearing your browser data will reset the counter
